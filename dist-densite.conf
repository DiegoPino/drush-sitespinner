/**
 * DENSITE_WWW_HOME is optional constant you can set if you want to insure where
 * your drupal standalone base installs will be placed. No trailing slash (/) should be
 * used! If empty '' the function will guess the placement of your www_home. The guess is
 * based on the following: 
 * 
 * Normally you have a user who creates the websites, e.g. user. This user has a home:
 * /home/user
 *
 * Then you will have a folder for your websites lives e.g. www. The script does not
 * care if the name is www. It could alo be web-data or anything else:
 * /home/user/www
 *
 * Websites e.g. www.yoursite.org will be placed like this:
 * /home/user/www/www.yoursite.org
 *
 * The www.yoursite.org folder will have a htdocs and a logs folder like this:
 * /home/user/www/www.yoursite.org/htdocs
 * /home/user/www/www.yoursite.org/logs
 * 
 * This only affects the situation where you make the script make new base installs
 * of a drupal install using the drush densite standalone command. 
 * 
 * Lets say you have a base install of drupal in:
 * /home/user/www/www.yoursite.org/htdocs
 * 
 * When executing e.g. 'drush densite_main www.newsite.org' in 
 * /home/user/www/www.yoursite.org/htdocs then your new site will be placed in 
 * /home/user/www/www.newsite.org/htdocs
 * 
 * If you want to change this to a hardcoded base, set DENSITE_WWW_HOME, but I would not. 
 * The default option insures a sane environment.
